In this tutorial we will apply VQE to the transverse field Ising model. VQE is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm where a quantum computer aids in the calculation of expectation values of observables. The quantum computer is used to prepare a trial state $|{\\psi(\\theta)}\\rangle$ where $\\theta$ is determined classically according to the goal of minimizing the expectation value of the energy with respect to $|{\\psi(\\theta)}\\rangle$, $E = \\langle{\\psi(\\theta)}|H|{\\psi(\\theta)}\\rangle$. Finding the parameter(s) $\\theta$ for which $E$ is minimum allows us to estimate the groundstate $|{g}\\rangle$ of $H$, i.e. where $H|{g}\\rangle=E_g|{g}\\rangle$ and where any state $|{\\psi(\\theta)}\\rangle$ parameterised by $\\theta$ satisfies $\\langle{\\psi(\\theta)}|H|{\\psi(\\theta)}\\rangle\\geq E_g$.

A potential issue with this method is that we might get stuck in a local minima. Update the code below by adding an inner loop that runs the optimizer 10 times using different `symbol_vals` and picks the best result for each value $h$. This best result can then be appended to the `results_site` list.\n",
